# Detrended Price Oscillator

Detrended Price Oscillator is custom indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It is a kind of oscillator indicator that calculates the ratio of the current price to the moving average from some fixed number of periods ago.

Although Detrended Price Oscillator is meant to give buy and sell signals when it crosses the zero level, its best use is for divergence trading when the currency rate sets a new higher high or lower low, while the indicator shows a lower high or higher low.
